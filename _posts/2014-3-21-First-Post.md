title: In my endeavours to create a video game, I have accidentally created a Ferrero Rocher generator.
---

I am in the process of creating a planet generator for Cassmo. It works by creating an icosphere and then deforming it to form mountains and valleys. At the moment, the height of each vertex is totally random and unrelated to the vertex next to it:

![generated planet]()

[Un?]fortunately, this makes the planet look like an ice cream drumstick, or perhaps a Ferrero Rocher:

![Ferrero Rocher planet]( "Ferrero Rocher planet")
![coconut Ferrero Rocher planet]( "Coconut Ferrero Rocher planet")

I'm considering keeping it.
